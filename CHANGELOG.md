**NB - Backwards compatibility breaking changes:**
- `7777` Network deprecation and the upgrade to a new p2p layer breaks compatibility with previous versions of Komodo DeFi Framework. Connections between nodes/clients running an older version of Komodo DeFi Framework and nodes/clients running this latest version will not be possible. To avoid this, all nodes/clients must be upgraded to the latest version of Komodo DeFi Framework.
- Because of KMD burn of a part of the taker fee, the taker fee outputs for any `coin/KMD` swap are changed and makers running older versions will not be able to validate the taker fee, this will cause the swap to fail. This case will never happen anyway because older versions will not be able to connect to this latest version due to the network upgrade.
- Because of the removal of the fixed 0.0001 min threshold for TakerFee, taker fee validation will also fail for these cases. Again, this case will never happen as the previous case.

  - Some unit tests were added for multi path payments in [#1655](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1655)
  - Some unit tests for claiming swaps on-chain for closed channels were added in [#1655](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1655), these unit tests are currently failing.
  - `protocol_info` fields are now used to check if a lightning order can be matched or not in [#1655](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1655)
  - 2 issues discovered while executing a KMD/LNBTC swap were fixed in [#1655](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1655), these issues were:
    - When electrums were down, if a channel was closed, the channel closing transaction wasn't broadcasted. A check for a network error to rebroadcast the tx after a delay was added.
    - If an invoice payment failed, retring paying the same invoice would cause the payment to not be updated to successful in the DB even if it were successful. A method to update the payment in the DB was added to fix this.
  - `mm2_git` crate was added to provide an abstraction layer on Git for doing query/parse operations over the repositories [#1636](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1636)

**Enhancements/Fixes:**
- Use `env_logger` to achieve flexible log filtering [#1725](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1725)
- IndexedDB Cursor can now iterate over the items step-by-step [#1678](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1678)
- Uuid lib was update from v0.7.4 to v1.2.2 in [#1655](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1655)

- Tendermint account sequence problem due to running multiple instances were fixed in [#1694](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1694)
- Maker/taker pubkeys were added to new columns in `stats_swaps` table in [#1665](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1665) and [#1717](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1717)
- Get rid of unnecessary / old dependencies: `crossterm`, `crossterm_winapi`, `mio 0.7.13`, `miow`, `ntapi`, `signal-hook`, `signal-hook-mio` in [#1710](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1710)
- A bug that caused EVM swap payments validation to fail because the tx was not available yet in the RPC node when calling `eth_getTransactionByHash` was fixed in [#1716](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1716). `eth_getTransactionByHash` in now retried in `wait_for_confirmations` until tx is found in the RPC node, this makes sure that the transaction is returned from `eth_getTransactionByHash` later when validating.

- RPC calls for evm chains was reduced in `wait_for_confirmations` function in [#1724](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1724)
